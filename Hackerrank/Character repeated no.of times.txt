Tara has been assigned a task by her friends to retrieve a character that appears most number of the times in a given sequence.
If the frequency of two or more characters is same than return the first character that occurs in the string among them.

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();
        int[] frequencyTable = new int[256];
        for (int i = 0; i < inputString.length(); i++) {
            char ch = inputString.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(ch)) {
                frequencyTable[ch]++;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Error");
                return;
            }
        }
        char maxChar = '\0';
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
            if (frequencyTable[i] > maxFreq) {
                maxChar = (char) i;
                maxFreq = frequencyTable[i];
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Maximum occurring character is: " + maxChar);
    }
}
