Dr. Max has conducted the academic task in his class with 5 Multiple Choice Questions each having 4 options A/B/C/D. He wanted to write a program which can 
evaluate the test papers of all the N students such that each correct answer is awarded 1 mark and for incorrect answer penalty is 0.25 marks.The program must read the 
number of students N and the the answers of all the N students in the form of a String. If any question is not attempted by any student, then X should be given as input 
corresponding to that question e.g. ABAXD. It is expected that the marks of all the N students are displayed separated by SPACE.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String correctAnswers = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase();
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String studentAnswers = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase();
            if (studentAnswers.length() != correctAnswers.length()) {
                System.out.println("Incorrect Input");
                return;
            }
            double marks = 0.0;
            for (int j = 0; j < correctAnswers.length(); j++) {
                if (studentAnswers.charAt(j) == 'X') {
                    continue;
                }
                if (studentAnswers.charAt(j) == correctAnswers.charAt(j)) {
                    marks += 1.0;
                } else {
                    marks -= 0.25;
                }
            }
            System.out.print(marks + " ");
        }
    }
}
