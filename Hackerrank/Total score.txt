Consider that there is a cricket player named Smith who hits certain number of 4s and 6s in a cricket match. 
Find out total numbers of scores he makes with his 4s & 6s only.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main 
{
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num4s = sc.nextInt();
        int num6s = sc.nextInt();
        int totalScore = num4s * 4 + num6s * 6;
        System.out.println(totalScore);
    }
}
